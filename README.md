<b> Notes on the gff3 file on the human genome </b>

The size of the gff3 file 'Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.85.gff3' is too big to be uploaded on GitHub, even in its zipped form (see <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://github.com/annacormio/genomeAnnotation_Genomics_2023/blob/master/.gitignore' > .gitignore</a>). Hence, we provide the following <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P4nYtl_SYNegCbWsoR-syltB84WOyaOp/view' target = '_blank'> link</a> from which the user can download the file.

* The file must be saved <i>exactly</i> as Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.85.gff3, or the code will not work. While we recognise this lack of generalisation, the specification of the project requested to design a program specific for reading the data cointained in the aforementioned gff3 document.
* The Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.85.gff3 file must be saved in the <a href = 'https://github.com/annacormio/genomeAnnotation_Genomics_2023/tree/master/dataset' target="__blank"> dataset</a> folder.
